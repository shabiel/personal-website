            <h2>About this article</h2>
            <p>Resource Patient Management System (RPMS) is the Electronic Health Record used
            in Indian Health Service (IHS). A full bibliography can be found at the end
            of the article.</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Sources: Dr. Curtis in book and the IHS website</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>IHS is part of the US Department of the Health and Human Services (HHS), like
            the National Institutes for Health and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). It
            exists to provide health care for Native Americans.</p>
            <p>From the IHS website <a href="http://www.ihs.gov/aboutihs/">http://www.ihs.gov/aboutihs/</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The provision of health services to members of federally-recognized tribes
                grew out of the special government-to-government relationship between the
                federal government and Indian tribes. This relationship, established in 1787,
                is based on Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, and has been given form
                and substance by numerous treaties, laws, Supreme Court decisions, and
                Executive Orders. The IHS is the principal federal health care provider and
                health advocate for Indian people, and its goal is to raise their health status
                to the highest possible level. The IHS provides a comprehensive health service
                delivery system for approximately 2.1 million American Indians and Alaska
                Natives out of the total 3.4 million who belong to 566 federally recognized
                tribes in 35 states. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Currently the federal IHS sites consist of 28 hospitals, 61 health centers, and
            33 health stations. In addition, 33 urban Indian health projects provide a
            variety of health and referral services. Through P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination
            contracts, American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native corporations administer 16
            hospitals, 235 health centers, 75 health stations, and 164 Alaska village
            clinics.</p>
            <p>IHS's budget is around $4 billion.</p>
            <p>RPMS is used in all IHS sites and many tribal sites.</p>

            <h2>RADEN</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Sources: Bill Mason, Jim Garvie, Clayton Curtis</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The very first computer system used in IHS was the Remote Access Data Entry
            Network (RADEN) deployed in 1974 [CC]. Its sole purpose was to administer the
            IHS Contract Health Program [BM] (for more, see
            <a href="http://www.ihs.gov/newsroom/factsheets/contracthealthservices/">http://www.ihs.gov/newsroom/factsheets/contracthealthservices/</a>). RADEN
            was used to capture information for contracting and billing with outside
            providers delivering services to IHS patients and to print authorizations for
            those outside providers to render their services.</p>
            <p>RADEN was written in assembly language and ran on NCR mini-computers at the
            area offices. Data entered into RADEN was transmitted to the NPRS (National
            Patient Reporting System) in Albuquerque, NM.</p>
            <p>In later phases, RADEN was also used to enter Ambulatory Primary Care (APC) 
            data into the system for transmission to NPRS. APC forms were essentially
            bubble sheets filled by the providers and sent to area offices for keying into
            RADEN.</p>
            <p>The main historical significance of RADEN as it relates to RPMS is that it
            brought computers into the IHS area offices. It was not a mainly clinical 
            system.</p>
            <p>Today, RADEN's function is performed using the RPMS CHS and RCIS packages.</p>
            <h2>Planning for PCIS</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Sources: Greg Shorr</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>PCIS started with Stew Rabeau. In the late 50's, he was the only physician in
            Northern Alaska. To get to his patients, he had to fly to them. Dr. Rabeau
            eventually became the Area Director for Alaska, and then the Head of Indian
            Health Service. He had a vision of using emerging computing technology in
            health. To that effect, he established the Tucson Office in 1963, and appointed
            himself as the head of the Office of Research and Development. To staff his new
            office, he looked for talent, and managed to recruit NASA scientists who needed
            jobs after the conclusion of the Mercury Project.</p>
            <p>In 1967, the office leased an IBM 360 from Bell Aerospace. Their program focused
            on Disease Modeling as its main objective. After a talk from Larry Weed
            regarding an approach to medical documentation (since then known as the problem
            oriented medical record), the first system was designed around Encounter Purpose
            of Visits and Chronic Problems. Go-live for the system was in 1969. Ted Garret
            was the original programmer, and the system was written in COBOL and Fortran.</p>
            <h2>HIS and PCIS</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Sources: Bill Mason, Clayton Curtis, Ted Garrett's paper, Greg Shorr</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Development of its first true clinical precursor (Health Information
            System—HIS) was started in 1967 by Dr. Ted Garrett at Bell Aerosystems as part
            of a project of the IHS Office of Research and Development located in Tucson,
            Arizona. HIS was renamed to Patient Care Information System (PCIS) when it was
            moved to IHS servers in Albuquerque in the 1970s from Bell Aerosystems.</p>
            <p>PCIS consisted of a COBOL program running IBM 370-145 mainframe 
            against IBM Model 204 database and followed a problem-oriented medical record.
            Physicians filled in triplicate encounter forms which were entered by clerks
            into the mainframe; health summaries were printed and mailed back to the
            clinic. Updated health summaries were sent back every two weeks to the clinics.
            The Tucson area had on-line access to the system.</p>
            <p>PCIS consisted of the following components (printed on a health summary):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demographics</li>
                <li>Problem List</li>
                <li>Lab Results</li>
                <li>Dental</li>
                <li>Behavioral Health</li>
                <li>Community Health Representatives/Village Aides</li>
                <li>Measurements</li>
                <li>Immunizations and Skin Test</li>
                <li>Diagnoses</li>
                <li>Medications</li>
                <li>Health Maintenance Reminders</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Initial PCIS Implementation in Tucson</h3>
            <p>HIS/PCIS was implemented first in July 1969 at 4 facilities on the Tohona O'odham
            Reservation: Sells Hospital, San Xavier Health Center, San Rosa Health Center and
            Pisinimo Health Center</p>
            <p>The initial system collected outpatient data through encounter forms that were
            delivered to Tucson by courier. The structured form contained
            fields for vital signs, test results, purpose of visits, treatments, and a note
            in a SOAP format. A variation of this form exists to this day. Initially,
            Rebeau contracted with the Texas penal system for data entry; the yellow copy
            of the triplicate was sent by mail there, the data was keyed in by prisoners,
            and the data transferred to the mainframe owned by Bell Aerosystems over a 300-baud
            modem over phone couplers. This arrangement, while effective, had a
            turnaround time of about a month. It was eventually abandoned in favor of
            training tribal women to enter data for immediate access (a feature in IHS that
            persists to this day!). The results of the entered data was a Health Summary
            printed on a 100-baud dot-matrix printer. Data was available as Health
            Summaries via online teletype terminals at each of the facilities.</p>
            <p>According to Lori Butcher, at some point punch cards were used for data entry.</p>
            <h3>Movement of HIS to PCIS</h3>
            <p>When IHS moved HIS from a mainframe owned by Bell Aerosystems to an IHS
            mainframe in Albuquerque in the early 70s, it was named PCIS. PCIS is really
            the same system as HIS. At this same time, dedicated telephone lines to
            computer systems in Albuquerque were used.</p>
            <p>The system as initially developed lacked the ability to generate reports; soon
            this deficiency was addressed and real public health data was successfully
            extracted from the system.</p>
            <h3>PCIS Implementation in the Alaska Area and the Billings Area</h3>
            <p>PCIS was implemented in the Alaska area and Billings area in a total of 10
            hospitals and 10 health clinics. However, due to logistical difficulties, data
            was submitted to the mainframe in Albuquerque in a different way.</p>
            <p>In Alaska, the encounter forms were mailed to Tucson and then keyed into the
            system.  In Billings, the encounter forms were mailed to the area office and
            and entered from there.</p>
            <p>Albuquerque produced microfiche sheets and mailed these out to the Alaska and
            Billings areas. Actual paper health summaries were printed at the the data
            centers and sent to the facilities. In the meantime, only the Tucson area had a
            real-time connection to the mainframe computer in Albuquerque.</p>
            <h3>The People Involved in HIS/PCIS</h3>
            <p>The director of the HIS/PCIS implementation was Dr. Ted Garrett, starting at
            1967, working at the time for Bell Aerosystems. The first pilot of the system
            was done in 1968.</p>
            <p>The people involved:</p>
            <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th><th>Role</th><th>Worked for</th>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>Ted Garrett</td><td>PM</td><td>Bell</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Bill Mason </td><td>PM</td><td>IHS </td></tr>
            <tr><td>Jim McArthur</td><td>DBA</td><td>Bell</td></tr>
            <tr><td>John Guthrie </td><td>HS</td><td>Bell</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Bob Dolan </td><td></td><td>IHS</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Pete Krauss</td><td> </td><td>Bell</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Bob Vint </td><td>  </td><td>?</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>In 1969, Dr. Garrett moved to IHS and became the head of the project. Bill Mason
            became the chief of operations at Tucson area. Jim McArthur also moved from
            Bell to IHS.</p>
            <h3>PCIS and an Epidemiological Success</h3>
            <p>This is when Dr. Paul Nutting comes into the picture. (see Annals of Family
            Medicine 1:180-181 (2003)) Dr. Nutting was a pediatrician by training, and
            started his career in Indian Health Service. He had a strong interest in
            population-based research, and initially addressed the causes of infant
            mortality. According to Dr. Shorr, the infant mortality rate in the Tucson area
            reservations was 65 per 1000, 90% of which was due to infant gastroenteritis.
            (Dr. Shorr described his experiences to me as a physician at the time, and his
            first experience with a mom bringing her child stone cold to him.) Dr. Nutting
            contacted the World Health Organization for information and help. WHO described
            a recent concoction of sugar, salt and water for rehydrating children; but
            declined Dr. Nutting's request for information on the predictive factors of
            death in infants.</p>
            <p>Instead, Dr. Nutting and his team went to IHS pediatricians. He collected from
            the Health Information System 40 factors that are measured on the infants, and
            asked the IHS pediatricians to choose which ones were most likely to be
            correlated with infant mortality due to gastroenteritis. In 1973-74, regression
            analyses were conducted using those factors, and on these bases, a community
            health education program was launched based on the risk factors identified.
            This program utilized Village Health Workers to teach sanitation, care of
            infants during episodes of gastroenteritis, and hydration using the WHO
            rehydration formula.</p>
            <p>Dr. Shorr says that there did not seem to him to be any day-to-day results; in
            6 months, though, a priest happened to inquire why he had not been burying
            infants lately. In fact, when the data came in, the program was judged to be a
            great success; it proved instrumental in procuring congressional funding for
            more Village Health Workers. These Village Health Workers are the precursors to
            the present-day Community Health Representatives who play such an important part in
            today's health care to American Indians.</p>
            <h3>Significance of PCIS</h3>
            <p>PCIS was the first system of its kind except for COSTAR which ran at
            Massachusetts General Hospital. Its use in proactive epidemiology was the 
            very first in Public Health anywhere in the world.</p>
            <h3>PCIS References</h3>
            <p>More information on PCIS can be found in Dr. Garrett's paper in the Proceedings
            of the 3rd Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care, pp.856-
            858, available online at
            <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2231902/pdf/procascamc00013-0862.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2231902/pdf/procascamc00013-0862.pdf</a>
            and Dr. Curtis's article "Using DHCP Technology in Another Public Environment" in
            Kolodner, RM "Computerizing Large Integrated Health Networks".</p>
            <h2>PCIS and RADEN: Sequelae and Lessons for the future</h2>
            <p>PCIS's reliance on mainframe and non-DBMS technology made PCIS too
            expensive and inflexible for widespread implementation, as well as a constant
            targets for cutbacks. PCIS was never deployed beyond the three areas
            mentioned above. RADEN, the other computer system used in IHS, was
            difficult to move from its aging platform without a massive and expensive
            conversion effort. From this emerged three lessons for the future:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any system needs to be decentralized to the point of patient care;</li>
                <li>Any system needs to be vendor-independent and portable across hardwares; and</li>
                <li>There needs to be more local control over data systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Notwithstanding the problems encountered with PCIS, it ended up having a long
            life, only being sunsetted in the mid 90's.</p>
            <p>These principles were enshrined in IHS's first 5-year strategic plan for
            information systems developed in 1983.</p>
            <h2>The initial push for RPMS</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Sources: Dr. Curtis conversation and book, Bill Mason</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In 1983, a committee of Information System Center representatives from the 10
            regions met and decided on modernizing PCIS under the impetus of a Health
            Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) directive to find a cost
            accounting system for the agency. A survey of commercial systems carried out in
            response to the directive failed to identify any suitable system to be
            purchased.  However, the survey made IHS aware of aware of the
            VA's DHCP, functioning in a fairly early stage in most of the VA Hospitals,
            including ADT, Scheduling, Pharmacy, Registration, Kernel, and Fileman v12. It
            was looked at for close to a year.</p>
            <p>Dr. Wilford was the chair of the Information Systems Strategic Planning group.
            It included Bill Mason and Dave Bolec.  Almost at the same time, the ISC post
            and the ISAC (Information Systems Advisory Council) was created.</p>
            <p>In April 1984, Marty Ivers, director of the VA Center in San Francisco, talked
            to the ISAC group. The decision was then made to bring DHCP into IHS and
            leverage the VA investment. This recommendation was forwarded to IHS
            headquarters and approved. Dr. Walt Wolford, a dentist, the head of IHS
            Information Systems, was instrumental in this approval.</p>
            <p>A new acronym was chosen, RPMS (Resource and Patient Management System) to
            indicate that this was a different system. There was a great interest in
            longitudinal records, especially due to the legacy of Health Summaries and
            Encounter Forms in PCIS.</p>
            <h2>RPMS Development</h2>
            <h3>Initial RPMS Development</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Sources: Bill Mason and Clayton Curtis (book and conversation)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Development started informally in 1983, and officially in 1984. When RPMS was
            being developed, Dr. Garret and Jim McArthur moved to Albuquerque from Tucson. Dr.
            Garret was formally the head of the RPMS project. Jim was the head of
            Development in Albuquerque; Bill Mason in Tucson, David Selby in Oklahoma.
            Staffing in the 3 centers was not equal to the staffing at a single VA
            development center.</p>
            <p>According to Mr. Mason, the number of developers in the beginning of RPMS is as
            follows:
            * Albuquerque - 7 developers
            * Tucson - 7 developers
            * Oklahoma - 3 developers</p>
            <p>The developers of the Patient Care Component, what was PCIS and now an
            integral part of RPMS, were all based on Tucson. They are:
            - Bill Mason
            - Clayton Curtis
            - Don Enos
            - Lori Butcher.</p>
            <p>PCC was developed between 1983 and 1985.</p>
            <p>As a side note, Lori has become the most prolific and important developer in
            RPMS. Today she is the primary developer of 10 RPMS modules, including:
            - PCC
            - Behavioral Health
            - Diabetes Management System
            - Community Health Representative System
            - Uniform Data System
            - National Warehouse Data Export
            - Clinical Reporting System (CRS)
            - Government Performance Reporting Act (GPRA)</p>
            <p>Patient Registration was developed in Oklahoma between 1983-1984 by Larry 
            Dillingham. Outpatient Pharmacy was ported from VISTA by Jim McCain
            in Tucson. Scheduling was ported from VISTA by Christine Saddler in Alaska in
            1985.</p>
            <p>Bill Mason still has the first signed Health Summary ever produced on RPMS,
            (which he searched for to give me an exact date: May 27th 1986). Dr. Curtis was
            the developer of the Health Summary.</p>
            <h3>PCC Development, an excursion</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Sources: Clayton Curtis, Lori Butcher, Bill Mason</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The first step of starting with RPMS was loading all the legacy data located
            in PCIS. The data structure to hold that, the Patient Care Component (PCC), was 
            invented by Clayton Curtis, Don Enos, and Bill Mason.</p>
            <p>According to Dr. Curtis, it had the following goals:
            * Support front-line providers with generic capabilities
            * Meet longitudinal care goals common in IHS ambulatory settings
            * Integrate patient data from multiple disciplines and sources,
            even if they originated outside of IHS.
            * Provide reporting capabilities for administration.
            * Provide an index on the patient's health</p>
            <p>The development of PCC did not come about from a management directive;
            rather, it reflected the realities of a small rural and mobile patient
            population.</p>
            <p>Don Enos, Bob Dolan, Clayton Curtis, and Greg Shorr got help from Michael
            Distaso with designing the VISIT file. George Timson (personal conversation)
            said that he added forward and backwards relational navigation to Fileman at
            the time accommodate the VISIT file design. The VISIT file and its associated
            "V" files were the first expression of a relational idiom to data stored in
            Fileman, and Fileman's relational capabilities had to be developed specifically
            for these files.</p>
            <p>Lori related how they came up with the name for V Files. While she was working
            with the Fileman input templates, the Visit File for Measurements (the
            equivalent to VISTA vitals) was named the same as the main file containing
            Measurement types.  Both were called "Measurement". After consulting, the PCC
            team decided to rename the Measurements and any other Visit Data file to be
            prefixed by V. V MEASUREMENT, V PROVIDER, V POV were born. What's remarkable is
            that once the V File structure was developed, it hasn't changed.</p>
            <p>While not belonging to the V Files, the Problem list, a core component of PCIS,
            was one of the first files to be developed in PCC. Its purpose is to act as a
            communication tool among providers.</p>
            <p>At the same time as the development of PCC, almost hand in hand, Clayton Curtis designed
            the Health Summary to replicate what PCIS had as one of its core components.</p>
            <h3>Name and Numberspace</h3>
            <p>Lori says that Cameron Schlehuber, the longtime VA DBA, gave IHS the
            numberspace 9,000,000 to 9,999,999. As they expanded, they were also given
            90,000 to 99,999. For namespaces, they initially were like VA sites in
            getting A for local development. Eventually, IHS got B as a whole for all
            RPMS development.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Most of the development staff Bill Mason oversaw in Tucson were former or
            current Health Care providers:
            - Greg Shorr, MD, Physician
            - C Clayton Curtis, MD, Physician
            - David Grau, DMS, Dentist
            - Tom Love, a Public Health Nurse
            - Jim McCain, RPh, a Pharmacist
            - Diane Lopez, Medical Records Administrator, an analyst
            - Jason Lockwood, a Lab Tech
            - Stanley Griffith, MD, Physician, an analyst</p>
            <p>Non-clinicians also provided key contributions:
            - Aline Purnell, analyst
            - Don Enos, health analytics researcher, programmer
            - Lori Butcher, health analytics researcher, programmer</p>
            <h3>Hardware and Software Platforms on which RPMS was deployed</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Bill Mason</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>RPMS was initially installed on PDP-11 clones Plessy Peripheral systems, which were DEC clones. One area
            used Burrows mini-computers; but most other areas decided to use what
            Tucson had. There was no TCP/IP back then; users used dumb terminals running at
            300-500 baud. The MUMPS implementations used were MSM, DSM or Intersystems. Each
            area could pick which system to use. Tucson used DSM. The only area that used a
            DEC was Alaska.</p>
            <p>(Skipping ahead: the next computers to be used in the early 90's were IBM RISC
            mini-computers.  Unlike the earlier incarnations of DECs, they were a Unix
            operating system and MUMPS had to run as program on the operating system, rather
            then being the operating system itself. Mid-90's and further, LANs and PCs came
            to dominate.  Current RPMS MUMPS environments run on Cache on MS Windows and IBM
            AIX.)</p>
            <h3>Important Second-Generation PCC Applications</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Bill Mason</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A couple of important applications that were developed in the 80's bear
            mentioning as they constitute foundational philosophies of the RPMS software as
            a population based Medical Record. These are:
            - Query Manager (Q-Man), developed by Dr. Greg Shorr, an interactive query tool
            into RPMS.
            - Visit Generator (VGEN)/Patient Generator (PGEN), a more SQL-like approach to
            searching the RPMS database.</p>
            <h3>Inpatient Components of RPMS</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Lori Butcher, Chris Saddler, Linda Fells</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>RPMS was an Outpatient System from the outset. However, IHS has several
            hospitals; RPMS needed some inpatient facilities. Because of Alaska Native
            Medical Center's (ANMC) involvement at the outset, its programmers did that 
            work. The main programmers at ANMC were Christine Saddler (an infection control
            nurse) and Michael Schallock (a pharmacist).</p>
            <p>Just as RPMS was getting started, ANMC developed an admission package written
            in COBOL that ran on a WANG PS 100. It had 100 MB of disk space and 32 
            terminals that could be hooked into it. </p>
            <p>As mentioned in an earlier section, Ms. Saddler ported Scheduling from
            DHCP to RPMS in 1985.</p>
            <p>Linda Fells ported ADT from DHCP to RPMS in 1986 to 87. </p>
            <p>Ms. Saddler ported Inpatient Pharmacy from DHCP to RPMS in the late 80's.</p>
            <h2>IHS-VA Cooperation</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Clayton Curtis, Bill Mason</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There was a tremendous relationship with the VA. All of IHS developers worked
            with the San Francisco and Salt Lake City Development Center and they made many
            contributions to VA Kernel, VA Fileman, and VA Mailman. In 1986, the San
            Francisco ISC asked IHS for a formal Interagency Agreement. This was the first
            VA-IHS Interagency Agreement. Clayton Curtis wrote this agreement, which was
            renewed a few times.</p>
            <p>In 1988-9, the VA formed the Clinical Application Requirements Group, headed by
            Dr. Kolodner. Clayton Curtis was the IHS representative.</p>
            <p>The group helped developed spec for Fileman v 17 and network mailman.</p>
            <p>In 1994, Dr. Curtis became the chair of the Clinical Applications Requirements
            Group.</p>
            <h2>Initial Deployment of RPMS</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Jim Garvie, Lori Butcher, Bill Mason</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The Tucson area sites were the first to implement PCC and registration; some
            other sites implemented registration only; most of that happened in 1986.</p>
            <p>Convincing a first site to implement RPMS was difficult. Due to the interest of
            the Cherokee Hospital Leadership, as well the Nashville Area CIO, James Garvie,
            Cherokee Hospital was the first site to implement the full production RPMS
            outside of the testing sites in Tucson and Alaska Native Medical Center.</p>
            <p>At the outset, Mr. Garvie worked closely with Bill Mason and demonstrated 
            early RPMS to the Cherokee staff. Jim Mills, the Service Unit Director, made 
            the trip to Tucson to see RPMS in action; and he scheduled his staff to see it.
            The Clinical Director, George Graning, and his wife, Mary Ann Ferrel, were
            practicing physicians that helped establish RPMS in Cherokee. Floyd Dennis 
            played a critical role in supporting the implementation in Cherokee. James
            Miller was the first Site Manager for Cherokee; indeed, he was the first
            Site Manager at any RPMS Site.</p>
            <p>A funny story that emerged out of the implementation is that prior to the
            implementation team having dinner that day, a few members (including Floyd
            Dennis and Diana Lopez) got into a car accident, which we are told was not
            serious. They were taken to the Cherokee Hospital, where PCC implementation was 
            set to start at midnight. Floyd and the others were offered the chance to be
            the first patients on which PCC forms would be filled out. They declined!</p>
            <p>To this day, the Cherokee Hospital is a center for RPMS demonstration and training.</p>
            <p>At the outset, only outpatient functionality was implemented in RPMS in
            Cherokee. From 1987 to 1988, Linda Fells at ANMC ported over some inpatient
            software from VISTA to RPMS. The ADT module was ported, but rather than rely
            on the VA-Centric Patient Treatment File (PTF), it was hooked to a new Visit
            file call V HOSPITALIZATION. Christine Saddler, also at ANMC, ported over 
            Inpatient Pharmacy from VISTA.</p>
            <p>An observant reader would notice that two core packages from RPMS are missing:
            Lab and Radiology. Lab was ported to RPMS in the late 80's by Christine
            Saddler. Frank Stalling from the VA was instrumental in helping port over 
            Lab. Randy Frommater (also from the VA) helped with configuring connectors
            to Lab Machines. VISTA Radiology actually never really made it into RPMS until 
            about 2002.</p>
            <p>By 1988, RPMS was operational in the Tucson Area sites, in Alaska Area sites,
            and in Nashville sites.</p>
            <h2>The long road to nationwide deployment</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Lori Butcher, Howard Hays</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There was no push to implement RPMS quickly after the first deployments. Where
            there was a push, it was done hand in hand with healthcare quality improvement.
            RPMS was pitched as a system to improve the quality of patient health. One
            of the longest-lived efforts was known as "Industrial Strength Triage". It was
            headed by Dr. Greg Shorr (a longtime IHS physician, and an RPMS developer).
            This is a way of doing visit planning based on protocols depending on how the
            patient presented. This process depended on and utilized RPMS, especially the
            Health Summary. Dr. Howard Hays (a physician) and Elizabeth Dickie (a nurse)
            assisted Dr. Shorr with Industrial Strength Triage implementation starting in
            the early 1990's. Dr. Shorr was instrumental in training the future leaders
            of IHS RPMS development.</p>
            <p>Mostly, the 1990's for RPMS was a period of consolidation and implementation. 
            By 1993, a GAO report <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/80/78677.pdf">http://www.gao.gov/assets/80/78677.pdf</a> estimated that 
            there were 229 sites operational with RPMS. However, even by 2000, there were
            some sites who had not yet implemented PCC.</p>
            <p>All in all, RPMS took about 15 years to be deployed to federal sites
            and interested tribal sites.</p>

            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Flagship RPMS population health queries were developed in the late 1980's and
            the early 1990's. The first application of its kind was Query Manager
            (popularly know as Q-Man), written by Dr. Shorr in 1988-89. In the early 90's,
            Lori Butcher wrote the Visit Generator and the Patient Generator (VGEN and
            PGEN). The Diabetes Audit application was already written (also by Ms. Butcher)
            in the late 80's. These tools were the forerunners to the GPRA Plus programs,
            which will be presented later. In the meantime, from 1994 to 1999, the CDC was
            very interested in using RPMS reporting capabilities to track several epidemics,
            including epidemics for Pertussis, Hepatitis A, and
            Shigella. RPMS enabled several police departments to track the incidence of 
            domestic violence as that was a PCC item captured by RPMS sites.</p>
            <p>Another prolific RPMS programmer, Michael Remillard, produced many applications.
            These notably include Immunizations (which in the author's opinion is
            the crown jewel of RPMS) and Women's Health.</p>
            <p>In the mid 1990's, Dr. Shorr, in one of many forthcoming comebacks, developed
            PCC-Plus. PCC-Plus was a program to print the encounter forms that providers
            filled out pre- populated with RPMS data. Due to its use of Microsoft Word's mail
            merge, it was able to use pleasing fonts rather than fixed-width fonts common
            to unformatted text. It should be noted that the PCC-Plus forms enabled 
            clinicians to more easily carry out Dr. Shorr's vision of "Industrial Strength
            Triage" as they did not have to locate a health summary anymore: the actual
            encounter form was also the health summary.</p>
            <p>In the 1990's, Pharmacy Point of Sale was developed. Electronic billing for
            insurances, Medicare, Medicaid was done via the new Accounts Receivable and
            Third Party Billing packages. These packages were initially developed by
            Michael Danielson.</p>
            <p>The Mental Health system, MHSS, one of the first fully electronic records in
            the country, was released in 1992.</p>
            <p>According to F.J. Evans, he developed the very first TCP broker implementation.
            The software utilizing that implementation, IHS Patient Chart, came in 1998.</p>
            <p>Linda Fells wrote a Prenatal module that was never certified in RPMS.</p>
            <h2>GPRA and GPRA Reporting</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Howard Hays and Theresa Cullen</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) was a Clinton-era legislation
            enacted in 1993. For IHS, in practice, it meant that if you are a Federal site,
            you must prove that you are working properly. You measure yourself manually and
            report that. There are a set of measurements that have been designated by IHS
            for GPRA (e.g. number of tobacco screenings). These measurements were
            done manually via random chart audits.</p>
            <p>Upon the suggestion of a Nurse located in the Aberdeen area, who noticed that
            most of the GPRA measures were extractable from RPMS, the Aberdeen area did the
            development for GPRA+, which checks RPMS for the measurements rather than
            have the checks be done manually. ITSC (the current name of the IHS division
            that develops RPMS) took over GPRA+ in 2002. The Clinical Reporting System
            (CRS) as it was eventually known, was released once every year. Dr. Stan
            Griffith was instrumental in its implementation.</p>
            <p>The existence of CRS was only possible due to the existence of Q-Man, VGEN and
            PGEN.</p>
            <p>CRS won the Davies award in HIMSS for RPMS in 2005. The Davies award was also
            given for Cherokee's use of EHR, RPMS and CRS.</p>
            <h2>The search for a fully Electronic Health Record</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Howard Hays</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Unlike VISTA, RPMS was designed to be very low-tech for its users. Providing
            a front end to providers was not a priority in RPMS development. That started
            changing in the beginning of the 2000's.</p>
            <p>The Physician Specialty Group, the group that evaluated software for physicians
            for inclusion into RPMS, hosted a demo of a Windows GUI software on top of
            VISTA called "VistAtion" in 2000. Mike Danielson was responsible for bringing
            it to the attention of the group; he met the creator in a VA Information
            Technology Conference in Austin where it was demoed.</p>
            <p>VistAtion was created by Dr. Douglas Martin, a prolific writer of VISTA
            software (his team's creations include the CIRN Clinical Data Repository; GUI
            Mail; an early implementation of reminder dialogs/order checking) at the
            Indianapolis VA.  VistAtion was designed as a modular alternative to CPRS.
            VistAtion was never deployed in the VA due to political pressures against it.</p>
            <p>VistAtion was written in Delphi, like CPRS; however, it loaded COM 
            (i.e. ActiveX) objects as components into a central framework. The COM objects
            can be written in any language that supports creation of COM objects.</p>
            <p>In 2002, in the Billings area, Mike Danielson and Robert Byron connected with
            Dr. Douglas Martin and his company Clinical Informatics Associates (CIA) to
            conduct a pilot of VistAtion in the Crow Hospital.</p>
            <p>Dr. Douglas Martin, Dick Roskam, and Phillip Salmon formed CIA after they left
            the VA. In 2002, VistAtion, now known as VueCentric, was implemented in the
            Crow Hospital with very limited functionality, being used only by one or two
            providers in the inpatient setting.</p>
            <h3>Decisions decisions</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Howard Hays</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In the summer of 2002, the Area Director for the Billings area, Dewayne Genone,
            was very impressed with VueCentric during a visit to the Crow Hospital and
            thought that the rest of IHS should use it. As fate would have it, he got
            reassigned to a senior position in IHS Headquarters.</p>
            <p>Russel Pittman, head of the Albuquerque ISC, asked Dr. Hays to take a look at
            VueCentric. It was functioning in Crow in a very rudimentary capacity and was
            only being used by two clinicians.</p>
            <p>In 2003, in the National Combined Councils meeting, a discussion took place on
            what GUI front-end should clinicians use in RPMS. F.J. Evans pitched Patient
            Chart, a currently functioning GUI software for RPMS that he created. Others
            pitched VueCentic; but the concern was that VueCentric was at CPRS version 20
            compared to what the VA was currently using, version 24.</p>
            <p>In 2003, the marching orders came to explore VueCentric for adoption by IHS.
            Some of the people involved in the early exploration included Roy Willie, Chris
            changes that was deemed necessary in RPMS was the implementation of Pharmacy 7.</p>
            <p>In September 2003, Dr. Charles Grimm, the IHS Director, made a public statement
            that 20 Federal Sites will implement RPMS-EHR (the new name for the VueCentric
            GUI) by 2005; and all of them would be on it by 2008. This statement was made
            despite the fact that the VueCentric at the time was only running in a limited
            capacity at the Crow Hospital. This was a hard deadline to meet.</p>

            <p>RPMS-EHR was developed from Fall of 2003 to Summer of 2004. Dr. Hays was in
            charge of programming for RPMS-EHR.</p>
            <p>From Fall 2003 to 2004, development was a scramble to get everything working.</p>
            <p>As VistAtion was a pure VISTA product, it did not communicate with PCC.
            The PCC components and Remote Procedures for these were written by Mike 
            Danielson in Visual Basic COM objects as a front end. These included all the
            Visit components, Immunizations, and the Problem List, as the VA had modified
            the Problem List package since it has received it from RPMS.</p>
            <p>Christine Saddler ported over the Radiology package and implemented Code Set
            Versioning.</p>
            <p>Linda Fells performed the necessary upgrades to PIMS and ported TIU to RPMS.</p>
            <p>Pharmacy 7 adaptation to RPMS was done by Phil Salmon.</p>
            <p>Phil Salmon was responsible for the installation of the software at IHS sites.</p>
            <p>Douglas Martin was in charge of the overall front end changes required
            for VA packages to work with RPMS.</p>
            <p>Mary Hager did a lot of the VA Health Summary work and Reminders work.</p>
            <p>Douglas Martin and Phil Salmon developed a virgin version of RPMS for training,
            the very first of its kind. All previous training versions of RPMS were
            scrambled RPMS database; a clean version of an RPMS database didn't exist.</p>
            <p>Pam Schweitzer was in charge of File Boxes of Test Scripts.</p>
            <p>In late 2004, there were 7 test sites, including Warm Springs, Cherokee, and Fort
            Defiance.</p>
            <h3>Deploying RPMS-EHR</h3>
            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <p>To implement RPMS-EHR, training and outreach was assigned to David Taylor.
            Each area had to come up with sites. In the end, twenty sites were implemented
            by the end of 2005, meeting the deadline set by Dr. Grimm.</p>
            <p>A comprehensive plan and roadmap were laid out to sites for implementation.
            Implementation was self-driven, with limited national IHS assistance.</p>
            <p>At the time RPMS-EHR was deployed, Keith Longie was the CIO and Jim Garvie was
            Acting Deputy Director for the Office of Information Technology (OIT).</p>
            <p>In 2006, Medsphere acquired CIA.</p>

            </blockquote>
                <p>In the meantime, while RPMS-EHR was being implemented, development of better
                population health tools was being spearheaded by Dr. Cullen, at the time the
                CIO for IHS.</p>
            <h3>iCare</h3>
            <p>Work on prototype for a GUI for HIV Management was started by Dr. Horace Whitt, a dentist, based on Dr. Cullen's ideas. Following his retirement, it was contracted to DAOU. The initial results were disappointing; IHS asked for a new
            development team. DAOU assigned Eric Perreli, Arlis Acord, and Bill Williams.
            HMS eventually grew into the IHS population management GUI called iCare. On the
            IHS side, the project was run by Cynthia Gebremariam, Dr. Cullen, and Linda
            Bethea.</p>
            <p>DAOU was acquired by Proxicom, who was acquired by Vangent, who was acquired by
            GDIT. However, the team supporting iCare has stayed the same.</p>
            <p>iCare 1.0 was released in the summer of 2007.</p>
            <h2>GUIs for other people</h2>
            <h3>Scheduling GUI</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Personal experience, Greg Shorr</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Horace Whitt's greatest contribution was creating a Scheduling GUI for RPMS
            that was written from the ground up. This was released in 2006. Dr. Whitt also
            created a new broker for RPMS to accommodate the needs of Microsoft .Net ADO.net
            data structures to use in the Scheduling GUI. Dr. Shorr participated in the
            broker project.</p>
            <h3>Registration GUI</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Howard Hays</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>More recently, a registration GUI has been written.</p>
            <h2>Filling in the Gaps in RPMS</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Susan Pierce, Greg Shorr</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Moving from a paper-based system to an electronic system meant losing some
            of the flexibility of paper. Some of these applications were very resistant
            to being computerized; if they were, TIU notes were used, which unfortunately
            do not code the data at all.</p>
            <h3>Well-Child Module</h3>
            <p>Dr. Greg Shorr, in another comeback, developed the Well-Child module. Because
            the questionnaire-oriented forms had no equivalent in VISTA (outside of the new
            VISTA Mental Health packages), they had to wait following the deployment of 
            RPMS-EHR. The Well-Child module used the broker that Dr. Whitt wrote.</p>
            <h3>Prenatal Module</h3>
            <p>We mentioned that Linda Fells created the first version of the Prenatal Module
            in the late 1990s.  Prenatal care is a notoriously hard area to computerize.
            Dr. Shorr (again!) did the programming for the Prenatal care module. All in
            all, the software was rejected 3 more times (in addition to the time that Linda
            Fells worked on it) until it was deemed usable enough to be included in RPMS.</p>
            <h3>Optometry Support</h3>
            <p>This is another area which has no VISTA equivalent. RPMS has recently added
            limited Optometry support to help document Optometry readings as structured
            data.</p>
            <h2>RPMS beyond IHS</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Source: Jim Garvie, Jack Schaffer, Chris Uyehara</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The Community Health Clinics of West Virginia was a prospective pilot site for
            the Vista Office Project. The parties involved didn't like the poor support of
            VISTA for Pediatrics. They saw RPMS, and hired Medsphere to implement it.
            However, this implementation did not last for too long. Due to the high costs
            of supporting RPMS, and the difficulty of configuring the practice management
            systems in RPMS in a private sector setting, the clinics eventually started
            dropping RPMS in favor of Athena Health. In the end, the decision to leave RPMS
            was a difficult one but was made primarily to have better billing functionality
            in Athena Health.</p>
            <p>Most of the Hawaii public health system uses RPMS. It is not known how they got
            started. Hawaii clinics using RPMS, unlike the West Virginia clinics, actually
            were already using VISTA from the Vista Office Project. Again, due to the poor
            support of VISTA for Pediatrics, Women's Health, and in addition due to the 
            lack of Patient Management modules in VISTA, the clinics and hospital moved to
            RPMS.</p>
            <p>Some clinics in American Guam run RPMS.</p>
            <h2>What does the future hold?</h2>
            <p>RPMS has been very strong with keeping current with Federal requirements.
            It was the first VISTA-related EHR to be certified for Meaningful Use Stage I,
            and it will be the first to certify for Stage II. It is continuously being
            improved with visible changes year to year.</p>
            <p>However, one thing that has really hurt RPMS is the lack of able and competent
            support inside and outside of IHS, plus the cost that it takes to support it.</p>
            <p>One of the flagship sites running RPMS, Alaska Native Medical Center, switched
            to Cerner in the mid-2000s due to the fact that they were actually supporting
            RPMS with heavy modifications and heavy imports from VISTA. It's not known
            how well this is working out for them.</p>
            <p>Tribal sites, unlike Federal Sites, do not have to run RPMS. Many of them, 
            especially those located in California, use NextGen.</p>
            <h2>Lessons learned about RPMS development and Support</h2>
            <p>If I may be permitted a bit of editorializing, here are a few lessons about RPMS development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's possible to fork VISTA and keep in sync with it as it is updated. You do need a long term commitment and good expertise to do it.</li>
                <li>The development of RPMS costs about 1/100th of the development of VISTA.  Ironically, RPMS software is frequently of higher quality than VISTA software.</li>
                <li>Support has always been the achilles heel of RPMS.</li>
                <li>Most of the software developers in the RPMS world have been women.</li>
            </ul>
