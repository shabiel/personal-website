<p>After a long week of editing our OSEHRA Docker scripts, I am proud to announce that we have a docker image for the Internationalized VistA instance that we have been developing.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/osehra/ov6/">here</a> to get going. There is a link there to get the clients as well. There is no need to install the KIDS build included in the download as all of its contents have been applied to the VistA Instance already.</p>
<p>As part of making this a good example to experiment with, I wrote a post-Installer that will add Korean Text to the Introductory message; and then change the providers' and patients' names to be a mix of Korean and Icelandic. While I tried to be culturally correct, that remains to be seen. Here are screenshots of the introductory screen and the patient selection prompt:</p>
