<p>This post focuses on modifying the VistA Lexicon to contain the Korean ICD-10 system in order for VistA to be usable in Korea for clinical purposes. We end up looking at two different ways in which we can do that.</p>
<h1 id="statement-of-the-task">Statement of the Task</h1>
<p>The Korean ICD-10 system used in Korea is known as KCD-7. We wanted to be able to use KCD-7 in CPRS for encounters instead of ICD-10-CM-US. The KCD-7 I was provided only included diagnoses, not the ICD-10 procedures. So my focus was only on diagnoses.</p>
<p>I was supplied a spreadsheet of the KCD-7 codes. Here's a screenshot</p>
<figure>

<h1 id="research-on-how-to-update-icd-10-codes">Research on how to Update ICD-10 Codes</h1>
<p>Before starting translation of the US entries, I did some research on how the ICD-10 codes are updated. I was lucky in finally receiving (after many attempts) a response to a FOIA request from the VA on the code that updates the Lexicon. I also was lucky in knowing a developer who worked on the Lexicon, who was able to answer some of the questions on some processes not documented in the code.</p>
<p>The FOIA response is a zip file <a href="https://github.com/OSEHRA-Sandbox/VistA-M/releases/download/kcd7/LEXFOIA_ICD-10_scrubbed.zip">over here</a>. For ease of reference, I extracted all the routines into the <a href="./reference-lex-icd10-code/">reference-lex-icd10-code</a> folder.</p>
<p>Here's a table of my summary exploration of the code.</p>

<p>IEN pre-calculation is rather intriguing. There is no reason that I could see to need to pre- calculate the IENs for the Lexicon. You could just get the next available number. Whatever the reason, the pre-calculation looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>ICD-10: 5 million to 7 million</li>
<li>SNOMED-CT: &gt;7 million</li>
<li>All other terminologies: Next available number; less than 5 million.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="initial-plan-and-surpise">Initial Plan and Surpise</h1>
<p>Initially, I thought that the task will simply involve the translation of ICD-10; essentially, the replacement of the English Text with Korean text. So that's what I started doing.</p>
<p>What I eventually found out though is that there was a low overlap between ICD-10-CM-US and KCD-7. Only 6286 of 12871 clinically selectable codes in KCD-7 were also clinically selectable in the US. I did not do a thorough investigation, but I think I can divide the issues into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li>The US version of ICD-10 is older, and does not contain many codes. E.g. X69.1, which is &quot;Intentional self-poisoning by and exposure to other and unspecified chemicals and noxious substances, residential institution&quot;.</li>
<li>Various US codes specify the number of times something happened (initial, episode, second episode, or more than that). Many of the accident codes (starting with with X) don't have any commonality due to that.</li>
<li>More detailed sub-specifications. Either the US version is more sub-specified; or the Korean version is. For example, to select a tuberculosis of the lung diagnosis in KCD-7, you need to to select A15.00 (Tuberculous of lung with cavitation, confirmed by sputum microscopy with or without culture), or A15.01 (Tuberculous of lung without cavitation or unspecified, confirmed by sputum microscopy with or without culture). In the US, you only have one code: A15.0, tuberculosis of the lung.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to that, doing a translation is not quite feasible. A translation would be a translation of ICD-10-CM-US, which are not the codes being used in Korea. So that left me with two avenues to pursue: Delete the US version and replace it with KCD-7; or inactivate the US version and add KCD-7. The latter option is harder and would have required more investigation; so I opted to doing the easier option: Replace ICD-10 in VistA.</p>
<h1 id="first-attempt-to-replace-icd-10">First Attempt to Replace ICD-10</h1>
<p>From the table above, you will notice that the code that calls <code>LEX^ZZLEXXAD</code> just creates new entries in all the files for any new codes. So I backtracked from that, assuming that to replace the US ICD-10, I need to delete all the ICD-10 codes add add new ones in their place. I did that, but later discovered that was the wrong way to do it. Later on in this document, I explain why. You can already see from the table below that the deletion process was rather messy.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-distribute-the-lexicon">How to Distribute the Lexicon</h1>
<p>Now that we have a new Lexicon, the big question is how to give it to others. I took a look at how the VA distributed their Lexicon. I read through the post-installs of the KIDS builds for the Lexicons, and I saw that they loaded a file system file that comes with the KIDS build containing data that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>S ^LEX(757,0)=&quot;MAJOR CONCEPT MAP^757P^7475423^769194&quot;
^LEXM(757,2)
S ^LEX(757,346250,0)=&quot;346250&quot;
^LEXM(757,3)
S ^LEX(757,346251,0)=&quot;346251&quot;
^LEXM(757,4)
S ^LEX(757,346252,0)=&quot;346252&quot;
^LEXM(757,5)
S ^LEX(757,346253,0)=&quot;346253&quot;
^LEXM(757,6)
S ^LEX(757,346254,0)=&quot;346254&quot;
^LEXM(757,7)
S ^LEX(757,346255,0)=&quot;346255&quot;
^LEXM(757,8)
S ^LEX(757,346256,0)=&quot;346256&quot;
^LEXM(757,9)
S ^LEX(757,&quot;B&quot;,346250,346250)=&quot;&quot;
^LEXM(757,10)
S ^LEX(757,&quot;B&quot;,346251,346251)=&quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This looks very similar to a global output format generated by various M implementations; and it's similar to how KIDS transports globals. But the question was: how did the developers generate this data, which seems to be a journal file dump? I looked at the VA Code that updates the ICD-10 codes, but there were no clues there. I had the fortune to talk to a developer who previously worked on the Lexicon team who told me the answer: there is a small program that compares an update instance of VistA with a reference non-update instance. Based on the comparison, the program generates set and kill statements that will bring up the non-update instance data to match the update instance data. The set and kill statements are distributed in a file (which is what we saw above) that accompanies each Lexicon patch (see the patches <a href="https://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/LEX-CLINICAL%20LEXICON/">here</a>). This patch is eventually installed on the non-update instance, making it now equal to the update instance; and now updating can begin again.</p>
<p>This method, while complicated, is actually the best way to generate the least amount of disk and cpu activity when installing a Lexicon patch into a VistA instance.</p>
<p>I did not get this information until after I created the first release. It was rather simple: Delete all the old Lexicon Globals for the files we modified, and replace them. Here's the list of the globals:</p>
<ul>
<li>ICD9</li>
<li>LEX(757)</li>
<li>LEX(757.001)</li>
<li>LEX(757.01)</li>
<li>LEX(757.02)</li>
<li>LEX(757.1)</li>
<li>LEX(757.033)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, this was rather computationally expensive as the globals were very large. The KIDS build file was 1.2GB large; and it took over an hour to install; plus it generated a large amount of Journal file activity.</p>
<h1 id="problems-with-first-attempt-to-load-icd-10">Problems with First Attempt to Load ICD-10</h1>
<p>I had a feeling that the way I was deleting entries in the Lexicon was incorrect because I saw seeing pointer entries being deleted that were not in the ICD-10 number range (if you recall, that's between 5000000-7000000). I had to understand the Lexicon better, so I decided to look carefully at one example of an entry that I deleted that wasn't supposed to be deleted. I used the Fileman pointer tools introduced in Fileman 22.2:</p>
<pre><code>***MAJOR CONCEPT MAP: 1650***
FILE 757.001 (CONCEPT USAGE)
         `1650        1650                        MAJOR CONCEPT

<p>As you can see, there are multiple coding systems (codes not shown above; see the tables below) using the same entry in the file Major Concept (#757) to say that all the codes for Anorexia; and all the expressions for saying Anorexia all mean the same thing. Therefore, while deleting the ICD-10 entry in the CODES file was okay to do, deleting all the pointed to entries was not, as they can be pointed to by other entries.</p>
<p>This analysis helped me figure out that the reference VA code that updated ICD-10 is not how it has been done historically; I was essentially following a flawed model.</p>
<p>While there is a more comprehensive diagram for the Lexicon in the VA manual, I decided to make this simple diagram for my and others' edification:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/lexicon-02-lexicon-diagram.png" alt="Simplified Lexicon Diagram" class="align-center" /><figcaption>Simplified Lexicon Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The dashed line between Codes and Major Concept says that there is a pointer connection between these files, but it's actually redundant as the same pointer can be found by going to the Expression file.</p>
<p>For comparison, on page 18 of the <a href="https://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/Lexicon_Utility/lextm2_0.pdf">technical manual</a>, you can find the more complex VA diagram, reproduced here:</p>

<p>A couple of interesting asides: Only 1465/72819 US ICD-10 code entries in the Lexicon are actually shared with other coding systems; and this is even less for SNOMED-CT. I personally speculate that asserting relationships between various vocabularies just became too much of a burden for the terminologists at the VA when all the codes that were used were SNOMED-CT and ICD-10 were first loaded.</p>
<h1 id="second-attempt-to-load-icd-10">Second Attempt to Load ICD-10</h1>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Rather than do the haphazard deletion technique used previously, to preserve existing relationships in the Lexicon, I would just delete codes in file 80 above 500,000 (ICD-10 codes); and all codes in the CODES files (757.02) that are marked as ICD-10 codes. Notice that we not deleting any of the associated codes in the other 757* files; these won't harm anything if they are left alone and nobody uses them. Ideally, I would look for all entries that nobody uses and then clean them up; but I imagine I would find a lot of interesting archaeology; so ultimately, it's not worth the time right now.</p>
<p>I never mentioned the Character Positions file before (757.003); this is used to categorize ICD-10 codes. I actually didn't know about it until this point in my research. I deleted the ICD-10 codes it from it, which were easy to identify as they were all labeled as &quot;10D&quot; in the NAME/.01 field.</p>
<p>Adding codes is done in two different steps. First, the straightforward loading of codes into file 80 and categories into file 753.033.</p>
<ul>
<li>80 (ICD DIAGNOSIS): .01 (code); 1 (coding system); 66 (status); 67 (short description); 68 (long description)</li>
<li>757.033 (Character Positions) for ICD-10 Categories (소 in KCD7 spreadsheet): 01 (10D + code); .02 (code); .03 (date); .04 (coding system); 1 (status); 2 (name/title); 3 (description)</li>
</ul>
<p>The second step is that we need to populate the other Lexicon files (757*). Previously, we created brand new entries in all files. However, we want to be true to the spirit of the Lexicon, and make sure that we create entries that will interoperate with the rest of the Lexicon. To do that, we now use the English text of the ICD from the KCD-7 spreadsheet to match to an existing expression in the Lexicon (file 757.01). If that exists, we use the Major Concept (757) and Semantic Class (757.1) associated with that. If not, we create brand new entries for the Major Concept (757) and Semantic Class (757.1) and English Expression (757.02). In both cases, we need to create the Korean Expression (757.02). The last item to create is the code. The code can be theoretically linked with either the English or Korean expression (as they are two separate entries pointing to the same Major Concept); but for this project I chose to point it to the Korean expression.</p>
<p>This all sounds too complicated. The <a href="https://github.com/OSEHRA-Sandbox/VistA-M/blob/plan-vi/Packages/Korea%20Specific%20Modifications/Routines/UKOP6LEX.m">source code</a> for importing the KCD-7 spreadsheet I hope is understandable, and may be a better reference. Start with the ADDLEX tag.</p>

<p>We end up reusing 1483 Expressions out of 19187 end user selectable codes in KCD-7. This is very close to the ICD-10-CM-US of 1465 of 72819.</p>
<h2 id="the-tilde-bug">The Tilde Bug</h2>
<p>There is a standard technique of jumping forward in a M index by appending a tilde to the text you want, and then using $ORDER to move forwards in the index. It's easy to explain this using an example. Say you have the following entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>CALCIUM CARBONATE</li>
<li>CALCIUM LACTATE</li>
<li>CALCIUM SULFATE</li>
<li>MAGNESIUM CARBONATE</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know that &quot;CALC&quot; expands to CALCIUM only, and you want to skip it, you can append ~ to CALC to jump to the MAGNESIUM using $ORDER.</p>
<p>This trick is used in a few places in Fileman with comma searching (partial wildcard matching of entries).</p>
<p>This trick works only with ASCII. It works because the tilde is the last printable ASCII character, so ordering past it will get you the next higher character. This won't work for any non-ASCII data. What usually happens is that you go into an endless loop with non-ASCII data as you never get to the end of an index (~ with non-ASCII data moves you back, not forward, and you loop through the data again, add the tilde, and go back, and so forth).</p>
<p>Luckily, I found this problem while I was working for EHS in Jordan when we were implementing VistA there. George Timson fixed it by introducing a new DD(&quot;OS&quot;) node called &quot;HIGHESTCHAR&quot;. Instead of a tilde, you are supposed to use ^DD(&quot;OS&quot;,^DD(&quot;OS&quot;),&quot;HIGHESTCHAR&quot;).</p>
<p>We found this issue in ONE^LEXAS2 and EXP^LEXAS6. They are now both fixed.</p>
<h2 id="random-pursuedunpusued-fileman-indexing-bugs">Random Pursued/Unpusued Fileman Indexing Bugs</h2>
<p>I have had multiple issues where Fileman would not create certain indexes. One of them has been remedied in MSC Fileman (DIC variable is not defined for DBS calls); while another has not (conditional subfile whole file indexes don't seem to get fired). Both of them made me double check why my code didn't work, and I found out it's because an index was not created. This was apparently known to the Lexicon developer, as he explicitly re-indexes the Lexicon entries after he files them; which he shouldn't really have to do.</p>

<h2 id="kids-build">KIDS Build</h2>
<p>In the section &quot;How to Distribute the Lexicon&quot;, we saw how the VA distributed the Lexicon; and how I ended up distributing the first draft of my copy of the Lexicon. Ideally I would have liked to distribute my KIDS build almost the same way that the VA distributed their Lexicon; however, the VA distribution of the Lexicon only works well when you only need to go from one state of the Lexicon to the next (as the sets and kills are very specific to a previous state; i.e., specific to the cumulative effect of all the previously installed KIDS patches). However, I would want to my build to be generic: it should be able to go in regardless of your Lexicon patch level. In the end, I decided that I will simply ship the KCD-7 spreadsheet inside of the KIDS build and load the KCD-7 in the post install the same way I was loading it on my development computer. The KIDS build also contains both LEXAS routines that had the tilde bug fixed. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/OSEHRA-Sandbox/VistA-M/releases/tag/kcd7">here</a>. The load takes about 10 minutes; most of the time is spent in the deletion of the US codes.</p>
<h1 id="an-experiement-loading-kcd-7-as-a-separate-terminology">An Experiement: Loading KCD-7 as a Separate Terminology</h1>
<h2 id="load-description">Load Description</h2>
<p>Due to community interest in being able to load a separate terminology into the Lexicon (such as DSM-5, which is not currently in the Lexicon), I decided to explore the possibility of loading KCD-7 as a Separate Terminology, rather than replacing the US ICD-10. The resulting routine can be found <a href="https://github.com/OSEHRASandbox/VistA-M/blob/planvi/Packages/Korea%20Specific%20Modifications/Routines/UKOP6LEX1.m">here</a>.</p>
<p>The steps are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Terminology Definition to CODING SYSTEMS (757.03)</li>
<li>Add Categories (if applicable) to CHARACTER POSITIONS (757.033)</li>
<li>Add User Selectable codes to the five main files discussed earlier: 757/757.001, 757.01, 757.02, 757.1. Use the Expression (English Text of the code (757.01) to decide if you can reuse the Major Concept (757) and Semantic Map entry (757.1) and the Expression itself (757.01). Otherwise, you will need to create all the entries in all five set of files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since with KCD-7 I had Korean text in addition to the English text, if I found an existing English language expression, I created a new Expression in Korean that was a synonym to the English expression. The Lexicon knows that the two expressions mean the same thing as they both point to the same major concept. The KCD-7 code in CODES (757.02) can point to either one--I made it point to the Korean Text.</p>
